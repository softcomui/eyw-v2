**Eyowo** believes in providing excellent service and strives to be sincere and transparent in its approach to customer service and support to sustain and achieve business growth. Your trust in us is of paramount importance to us and we would never place our personal growth before your interest. This Policy aims to minimize instances of customer complaints, grievances and disputes through a channelized approach of review and redress. Your feedback will help us in identifying shortcomings in our product features and service delivery. Your satisfaction is our main objective in our strive to build a healthy customer relationship and deliver excellent service.


This Policy aims at minimizing instances of customer complaints and grievances through proper service delivery and prompt redress of customer grievances. Eyowo has developed a procedure for prompt attention to grievances of the customers in respect of various issues. This is done by setting up a &quot;customer support&quot; and “a dispute resolution mechanism”.


The following are the underpinning principles of this policy:

- Transparency;
- Prompt, courteous and timeous response to all queries, enquiries and complaints; and
- Constantly developing new and smarter mechanisms to receive and address customer grievance. The details of dispute resolution mechanism are placed in the domain of public knowledge.


Dispute may occur as a result of several reasons. It may be because of the difference in the service expected and the service delivered. A dispute may also arise as a result of technical or non- technical errors in the system or at times due to human inadvertence or error. 

Eyowo provides a user-friendly platform to all its customers to file a complaint/ share feedback if they are disappointed by services rendered. Customers can give their complaint/ feedback in sending an email to: [support@eyowo.com](mailto:support@eyowo.com)

If the user’s grievance is not resolved within the stipulated time frame, or if the user is not completely satisfied with the solution provided by Eyowo, then they can approach our dispute resolution system with their complaint or explore other legal avenues available for dispute resolution.

In order to make Eyowo dispute resolution more meaningful and effective, a structured system has been put in place. This system will ensure that the complaints are redressed seamlessly and well within the stipulated timeframe.
