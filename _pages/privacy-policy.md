If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Any such information that the user provides in order to be able to use the App and its services

Information about Users that third parties provide on the App to augment or verify information; and

**A Payer** who is loading funds on the App with a credit card or debit card must provide his/her name, card number, expiration date, CVV code, country, and zip code (where applicable). A Payer who is paying on the App must provide the payee’s mobile number, also a payee who is making use of the electronic fund transfer must provide the bank details (name, mobile phone number and payee’s bank) of the payee.

Merchants or Payers may voluntarily provide additional information on the Company for example, when seeking customer support or in response to surveys or other inquiries. All information provided shall be kept strictly private and confidential by the Company save instances where the law requires disclosure or where necessary to provide a service to You.

##### Information Provided by Third Party
The Company may obtain information about Users from third parties, such as identity verification services, credit reporting services, and social networks such as Facebook or LinkedIn. The App may provide the Company with additional information such as the User’s transactional history on the Platform. The App may offer third party services based on its various integrations. The App may provide users information and transaction history upon Users personal request for a third party.

##### Automatically Provided Information
The Company or the App may automatically record certain information about or related to your use of the services and the App that is made available through your computer or device. Three of such technologies are described hereunder –

**Log Files** –  The App may collect internet protocol (IP) address browser type, device ID, internet service provider (ISP), information about your computer and software, links materials You request, your approximate location, referring/exit pages, date/time stamp, and other metadata. The App may embed Javascript code into page loads, which instructs Users’ web browsers to make web requests back to our servers to collect information about the User page views and other activities.

**Cookies** - The App collects certain information from the User’s browser using small data files called “cookies”. For example, The Company or the App may use session cookies to help recognize a User who visits multiple website pages during the same session so that the User does not have to enter a password to access each page. Session cookies terminate once the User closes the browser. The App also uses persistent cookies to collect, store and track information. For example, the App uses persistent cookies to store the User’s login ID (but not the User’s password) to make it easier for the User to login when the User returns to the website. We encode our cookies so that only us can interpret the information stored in them. You can remove or block persistent cookies using the settings in your browser, but this may limit your ability to use our Services.

**Clear GIFs and Web Beacons** – The Company or the App may employ a software technology called clear gifs or web beacons that help us better manage content on the App, by informing us effective content. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of the Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
