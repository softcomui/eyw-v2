Eyowo offers users the opportunity to withdraw cash from any supported Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). What’s more interesting about withdrawing funds domiciled in Eyowo is the fact that one doesn’t need a debit card to achieve this. To perform an Eyowo cardless cash-out at any supported ATM, you need to generate a Paycode and Cashout PIN.

### How to generate Eyowo Paycode and Cashout PIN
The Paycode and cashout PIN can be generated either through the Eyowo app (available on Android and iOS), via USSD (*4255#) or through the web app (app.eyowo.com).

#### On the mobile app

- Tap on your profile and from the menu grid.
- Select ‘Cash Out’. 
- Tap on the top-right icon.
- Enter the amount you wish to withdraw. 
- Authorize the transaction by entering your Eyowo PIN.
You will then receive a Paycode and Cashout PIN which you will take along with you to any of the supported ATMs.

#### Using USSD - *4255#

Feature phone users can also generate Eyowo Paycode and Cashout PIN via the *4255# USSD service. To achieve this, dial *4255# on your phone, select option 4 and follow the prompts. You will receive a text message containing your Paycode and Cashout PIN. With the  8 - 14 digit paycode and your cash out PIN, you can then proceed to any of the supported ATMs to carry out your cardless withdrawal.

#### Via web app

Log on to app.eyowo.com and sign in using your phone number and Eyowo secure PIN. On the menu, select the Cash Out tab. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw and enter your Eyowo PIN to authenticate the transaction. You will then receive your Cashout Paycode and PIN. Take the Cashout Paycode and PIN with you to the ATM for your cardless withdrawal.
